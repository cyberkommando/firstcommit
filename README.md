# My first mini project as c# on console and Unity
1. First I created a simple **csharp** program.
2. After I changed the default sentence to a funny one.
3. With that I started to continue my project on a Unity 3D project.
4. On that project I created a 3D object **(a cube)** and created a new script and put a code to rotate a translate that object.
5. After I opened my *gitbash* and signed up with my data and commited the download of my college moodle page (the unity to my unity folder, and the console to my first program).
6. On the git hub site I created a new repository and pushed all the files to that repository.
7. In the end I created on Visual Studio Code this README markdown text to help those who need.
